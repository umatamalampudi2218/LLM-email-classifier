"""## Prompt Engineering Summary

### How I Started
At first, I used a pretty basic prompt to classify emails like:
> "Classify the following email as complaint, inquiry, feedback, support_request, or other."

It worked okay for obvious cases but struggled when emails were polite, vague, or touched on multiple topics.

---

### What Went Wrong
1. **Polite complaints** were often misread as feedback.
2. **Emails asking for help** sometimes looked like complaints.
3. The model often returned more than just a category—like whole sentences.

---

### How I Fixed It
I improved the prompt to be very clear and direct:

```text
You're an AI that classifies emails into:
complaint, inquiry, feedback, support_request, or other.

Here’s the email:
[Subject]: <subject>
[Body]: <body>

Respond with only one word.
```

That made a big difference! The output became much more reliable and to the point.

---

### What Could Be Better
- Show examples in the prompt to teach the model.
- Ask follow-up questions if the email is unclear.
- Try OpenAI's newer structured outputs with function calls for even cleaner results.

## Design Choices & Lessons Learned

### Why I Built It This Way
I broke the project into three clean parts:
- `EmailProcessor`: Talks to the OpenAI model to classify and generate replies.
- `EmailAutomationSystem`: Runs the logic and picks what to do with each email.
- Some helper functions to simulate sending replies or making tickets.

This setup makes it easy to test, reuse, or swap out parts later.

---

### Real-Life Challenges
- The model wasn’t always consistent — using `temperature=0.0` helped a lot.
- Some emails had mixed messages, so classification wasn’t always simple.
- The model sometimes gave too much text instead of just the category.

---

### If I Had More Time...
- Connect it to a real email or ticketing system.
- Add a small dashboard to view results.
- Let it handle other languages.
- Log everything the model says for audit purposes.

---

### Final Thoughts
It all works as expected:
- Emails are classified and handled correctly.
- Responses sound professional.
- It’s ready for the real world (or a real API!).
