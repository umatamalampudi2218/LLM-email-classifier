# LLM Email Classifier & Response System

Welcome! This project demonstrates how to build a real-world, production-style system using **OpenAI’s GPT model** to:

* Automatically classify incoming customer emails by intent
* Generate personalized responses using prompt engineering
* Simulate operational workflows like ticketing and feedback logging

It’s designed with clarity, modularity, and extensibility in mind — just like you'd expect in an enterprise AI solution.

---

## What This Project Does

Using a sample dataset of customer emails, this system:

* **Classifies emails** into 5 categories:

  * `complaint`
  * `inquiry`
  * `feedback`
  * `support_request`
  * `other`
* **Generates LLM-powered responses** appropriate to each category
* **Routes the email** to a handler that simulates real-world actions like creating a support ticket or logging feedback
* **Logs results** for each email processed

---

## How It Works — Step by Step

### 1. Dataset

The notebook includes a predefined set of 5 mock emails simulating real customer messages. These are passed through the pipeline to test classification and response logic.

---

### 2. Classification (via `EmailProcessor` class)

* Uses `GPT-3.5 Turbo` from OpenAI.
* Constructs a structured prompt with clear definitions of each category.
* Instructs the model to return **only one valid category** as a single word.
* The classification is **validated** before being used.

Why this matters: LLMs can sometimes “hallucinate” outputs. By defining a strict format and validating results, we reduce that risk significantly.

---

### 3. Response Generation

Based on the classification, a second prompt is created with instructions such as:

* Apologize for complaints
* Acknowledge feedback with gratitude
* Provide next steps for support issues

This keeps responses polite, human-sounding, and tailored to the context.

---

### 4. Email Routing (via `EmailAutomationSystem` class)

Each email is routed to a handler based on its category:

* `complaint`: Sends response + creates an urgent ticket
* `support_request`: Sends response + creates a support ticket
* `feedback`: Sends response + logs feedback
* `inquiry` and `other`: Sends a general response

Each of these actions is simulated using mock functions.

---

### 5. Summary and Logging

The final step compiles a DataFrame summarizing:

* Classification result
* Whether a response was generated
* Whether the mock action succeeded

You can see this in the notebook’s `run_demonstration()` function.

## What’s Inside

* `LLM_email_classification.ipynb`: Final notebook with all logic, prompts, handlers, and demo
* `email_classifier_template.py`: Reusable class-based implementation (optional for production)
* `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages
* `README.md`: Project documentation (this file)

---

## How To Run It

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up your `.env` file** with your OpenAI API key:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Open the notebook** and run all cells, or run:

   ```python
   run_demonstration()
   ```

## Prompt Engineering Approach

Prompt design was critical to performance. Key features:

* Role declaration: “You are an AI assistant…”
* Explicit category options
* Output constraints: “Respond with a single word”

This improved model consistency and made parsing easier. Further iterations can add few-shot examples to handle complex or ambiguous emails.

---

## Future Improvements

* Add a real backend (e.g., connect to Zendesk, Gmail, or a database)
* Handle multilingual email inputs
* Add support for few-shot learning in classification
* Build a lightweight dashboard to monitor email flow
