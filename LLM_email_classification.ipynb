        "> \"Classify the following email as complaint, inquiry, feedback, support_request, or other.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "It worked okay for obvious cases but struggled when emails were polite, vague, or touched on multiple topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Went Wrong\n",
        "1. **Polite complaints** were often misread as feedback.\n",
        "2. **Emails asking for help** sometimes looked like complaints.\n",
        "3. The model often returned more than just a category—like whole sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### How I Fixed It\n",
        "I improved the prompt to be very clear and direct:\n",
        "\n",
        "```text\n",
        "You're an AI that classifies emails into:\n",
        "complaint, inquiry, feedback, support_request, or other.\n",

        "[Subject]: <subject>\n",
        "[Body]: <body>\n",
        "\n",
        "Respond with only one word.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "That made a big difference! The output became much more reliable and to the point.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Could Be Better\n",
        "- Show examples in the prompt to teach the model.\n",
        "- Ask follow-up questions if the email is unclear.\n",

        "### Real-Life Challenges\n",
        "- The model wasn’t always consistent — using `temperature=0.0` helped a lot.\n",
        "- Some emails had mixed messages, so classification wasn’t always simple.\n",
        "- The model sometimes gave too much text instead of just the category.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### If I Had More Time...\n",
        "- Connect it to a real email or ticketing system.\n",
        "- Add a small dashboard to view results.\n",
